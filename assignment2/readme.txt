This file is a short description on how to run the code and how the code is
structured with respect to the assignments.

STRUCTURE:
There are two implementation files:
KNN.py
  - Holds the implementation of assignment 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, the main() function
    will generate the results listed in the assignment paper

linregs.py
  - Holds the implementation of assignment 5, the main() function
    will generate the results listed in the assignment paper

plotting functions are also included in the two files but not called from main()

HOW TO RUN:
The programs are implemented in python 2.7, to run the programs respectively
python KNN.py
pyrhon linregs.py
